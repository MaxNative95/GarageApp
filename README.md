## Garage APP

![Screenshots](screenshots.png)

This repo is a working project that lists cars based on a local API response. It contains both the backend and the frontend app, and it aims at testing candidates' abilities to solve real-world problems, without demanding too much time setting up everything.

## Challenge ideas

### Homework

These tasks are recommended to be completed before the technical interview, where we will hold a pair-programming session with some extra quick tasks.

- [ ] Implement a relational DataBase (use SQLite for simplicity), with two entities, one for Makers and another for Cars. Use the same fields as provided by `cars.json` file. Each Maker can have several Cars.

- [ ] Consider implementing a resizing and cache system for served images. What approach would you take? What libraries or services? There's no need to implement it fully, but an example or a simple implementation will be appreciated.

- [ ] Implement a 'Detail' screen on the frontend app, following the same design principles and using the same information already provided.
